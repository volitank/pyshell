			aliasing: You can alias commands like so sh = pyshell(alias={'ls': ['ls', '-lah', '--color']})

		anytime you run sh.ls() you will actually run 'ls -lah --color'. This works for all commands as it does it by name

			input: can be either str or bytes. It will figure it out and switch text for you.
			shell: if you specify True it will use '/bin/bash'. You can also pass the shell instead of True, it's fine. shell='/bin/dash'

		The run function can override things that are defined in the object. If you just need one off command to work differently the use it.

		dash = pyshell(alias = {'ls': ['ls', '-lah', '--color']}, shell='/bin/dash')

		2. When specifying shell=True it will use '/bin/bash' by default instead of sh.

		Additionally you can pass a list to shell if you want more options.
		shell=['/bin/bash', '-O', 'extglob'] if you want to add extglob

		3. When using shell= you do not need to escape characters.
		What you have in quotes will be passed exact and the shell will expand.
